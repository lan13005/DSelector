# this is the config file that the fit scripts will look towards which is loaded by loadCfg.py for the python files and a grep command for the sh files

# IT WILL ALSO BE THE README
# countEventsInBins.C is used to get the events in each mass bin so we can see if there is a deficit which might hinder PWA
# fit_etapi_moments.cfg is copied by divideData.pl to all the bins
# fullFit.py with args: iProcess binsPerProc processSpawned will run a single process starting on bin=iProcess and then stepping by processSpawned with binsPerProc iterations. So 0 3 20 would run on bins 0, 20, 60
#	The reason we do this striding of bins is because the nearby bins should be similar in size, we want to homegenize. This program takes the amplitude ranges defined in this cfg file and samples from them. 
# fullFit_spawn.sh runs fullFit.py on all the bins. 
# bootFit.py and bootFit_spawn.sh does basically the same thing as the fullFit versions of them but this time it selects various random numbers as a seed for the bootstrapping. The intial amplitudes are based off of the converged
# 	amplitudes from the fullFit program. It allows a percent deviation from these converged values and a base shift. These values should probably be chosen such that the amplitudes are allowed to vary abit such that we aren't kind of #       enforcing some kind of similarity but also not allowing them to change too much as to hit a new minimum. Not sure if this makes sense....
# checkUniqueSeedsAllConverged.py is used to check if  bootFit_spawn.sh did the right thing and initialized the seeds properly for all the bins
# grabFull.py and grabBoot.py will look inside fitDir and grab all the amplitudes into individual files, one for each seed. 
# 	must use moveSeedSensi.sh first to move all the seed files to proper location. We can actually remove the need for moveSeedSensi.sh to save time but it cleans things up sort of 
# plotAmps.py can now run through all these files and plot the amplitudes using pyroot
# ------------------------- TYPICAL USUAGE ----------------------------
# DATA SETUP - we must first the data. DSelector_thrown outputs the data into 3 files with varying t. We still have to pass this through split_gen.C using run_split_thrown.sh.
#	     - WE MUST USE THE FLAT TREES FOR THE RECO AND DATA. HAVE TO CHANGE THE NAMES OF THE FLAT ROOT FILE IN THE DSELECTOR!!! THEN WE PASS IT THROUGH run_split.sh to get it correct form
